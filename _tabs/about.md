# Hi, I am **VulnX**

I am first year Computer Engineering student who loves everything related to computers. I've been learning programming languages for about 6-7 years.

![My Skills](/assets/img/my-skills-dark.svg){: w="500" .dark }

More specifically, I am passionate about `Cyber Security`. I thoroughly enjoy `Binary Exploitation`, `Exploit Development` and `Reverse Engineering`.

I also actively participate in CTFs with my team [ResetSec](https://ctftime.org/team/266022). As you might have guessed, my favourite categories are `PWN` and `Reverse Engineering` *(unless others are exceptionally easy)*.

Aside from that I have some intermediate knowledge of:
- Game Development with Unity
- 3D modelling with blender
- Web Development ( specifically front-end since I designed my [initial website](https://VulnX.github.io/old) from scatch )
- Video editing, VFX, CGI

In this website I plan to post my writeups for the CTF challenges I am able to solve and a few tips and tricks that I have learnt along the way. Since my [initial website](https://VulnX.github.io/old) has been decomissioned, I plan to shift the entire content to this new one gradually. This includes the `Buffer Overflow` series.

In 2019, when I first started with `Binary Exploitation` I absolutely fell in love with the concept but the learning curve was too steep. Luckily I found an excellent YouTube channel [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/@LiveOverflow) to guide me properly. I intend to compile resources from him and a few other content creators in a way which would have been just perfect for me when I started out, hoping that it will be useful to someone.
